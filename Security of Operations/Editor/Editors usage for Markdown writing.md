# Characteristics and advantages of using online markdown editors

Today, the world has moved from traditional paper-based note-taking to digital note-taking: the Internet is full of various apps that allow users to make notes digitally and store them in the cloud.

The advantages of digital note-taking are clear: almost every computer and mobile phone now has some note-taking or productivity-improving software (managing tasks, work processes, and cooperation with others) by default.

But of course, most of them are products of some large company, which means that they diligently collect user data, and you never know for sure if someone is looking into your notes. In addition, it also happens that a previously reliable, free or cheap product suddenly becomes more expensive, the available services are reduced, or data protection doubts arise.

With the spread of the home office lifestyle, various online group work solutions are increasingly emphasised. A large company mostly has well-proven tools for this purpose, but it is not always easy to find the right one in the case of a smaller SME or even a work community made up of individual entrepreneurs.

In this short report, we are looking for the answer to what markdown editors are on the market and what their characteristics and advantages are. In addition, we also mention a very important and often neglected topic: what cyber security aspects we should pay attention to when selecting and using them. But before we go any further, let's look at what we mean by markdown.

## 1. What is markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is one of the world's most popular markup languages, created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004. There are many reasons for its prevalence and popularity.

One is that it is a simple text formatting syntax that converts plain text to HTML. Another common reason many people use markdown is that it reduces the time spent on formatting and fixing formatting problems.

## 2. What are markdown editors?

Markdown editors are tools that help content creators format their work for the web using basic markup languages, such as hashtags, and save it in a format that can be brought to life in a wide variety of applications, regardless of the operating system. 

The markups are simple and easy to use to create lists, headers, and other types of content. Markdown files can be used in many writing applications or content publishing tools.

## 3. Why do so many people use markdown and markdown editors?

Most content creators use WYSIWYG "what you see is what you get" editors (such as Word, Pages, or Google Docs). These show exactly how your content will look after saving or publishing them online. 

One of the disadvantages of using them is that unless you use a style sheet, designing the content often takes more time than creating the content itself. Most users don't use a style sheet but inline formatting, which means they format the given content element individually. After a while (especially if it is a more extensive document), different styles may appear between these content elements.

Let's not even talk about the situation when one person does not prepare a given document; however, different people from different departments of a company start formatting the different content elements differently. And let's admit that this previous example is not out of the ordinary but very common.

Not to mention that these applications (for instance, Word, Google Docs, Pages, etc.) are not free, and the content created with them can only be opened and edited with them.

The limitations of platform dependency can also be a problem for personal use, but this is even more obvious at the corporate level: content created in Word is often only one stage of a workflow, and the doc/docx file must be converted, imported, etc., so that it can be used in other systems.

Markdown provides a one-step solution to the above problems. Its syntax works like a style sheet in, e.g. Word: it unifies the design, and the generated code can be easily exported and, depending on the editor, can be used on any platform. 

Learning the basic markdown syntax can be measured in minutes/hours. At the same time, e.g. in the case of Word, the most common word processor, it can take up to weeks and months before a complete novice user can use the application at a professional level.

The usage of markdown is common and widely supported. No matter what you write or where you want to import it, finding a tool that can correctly read Markdown formatting and use the created content on another platform or application is easy.

It is strange that, while Word is one of Microsoft's most complex products and its spectrum of functions is very broad, it is still the most widespread text editor worldwide. However, the vast majority of users use a fraction of Word's functions at a professional level, and there are many Word functions that they have never used or even heard of in their lives.

Despite everything, many Word users are still reluctant to use any markdown editor, even though the learning curve would be much shorter for them if they used one, so they could reach a more productive level sooner.

In standard word processors, you usually structure your text by adjusting its appearance on the go. In the case of using the markdown editor, the user can pay more attention to the content and the structure of the text since, instead of the design, you only have to focus on the content.


## 4. What types of markdown editors are there?

If you want to look for a markdown editor on the Internet, you will be surprised by the vast selection that awaits you. It is not easy to choose among them, but some selection criteria are listed here to help:

* Customizability of the editor
* Ease of use and quality of the user interface
* Features provided
* Developed for a specific writing audience, i.e. writers, coders, etc.
* Price of the application
* Security features

There are also pages on the Internet where you can find lists of different markdown editors, read about their properties, and compare them based on their features.

## 5. Comparison of some markdown editors

In the following, without claiming to be complete, we present some editors that we can recommend. The list is only a recommendation, and the order of the editors cannot be considered as any comparable order; only a couple of selected examples are shown.

### 5.1. Ulysses

If you only want to write on macOS, iOS and iPadOS, then [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) is one of the best markdown editors. 

Its built-in proofreader, style checker, and editing assistant are available in 20 languages. At the same time, its exporting features can turn your content into Word, PDF, epubs or blog posts (Ghost, WordPress, Medium, Microblog, etc.) with a single click. 

All your content is stored in the Ulysses library and seamlessly syncs across all connected devices, making your workflow smoother. It is a very reliable, feature-rich application that both novice content creators and professional writers can use.

The UI of Ulysses with Split View Editor – [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/ulysses-15-introduces-split-view-editor-new-image-export-and-previewing-features-and-keyword-management-improvements/)

Although the application is not free, if someone is looking for a professional, reliable tool, the [$40 per year](https://ulysses.app/pricing/) subscription is well worth it. The very detailed [online help](https://help.ulysses.app/kb/en), [video library](https://help.ulysses.app/kb/en/guides-124696) and [How to guide](https://help.ulysses.app/kb/en/faq-107238) also serve to familiarise yourself with and easily master the application quickly.

### 5.2. Inspire Writer

If you favour Windows, I can recommend [Inspire Writer](https://www.inspire-writer.com/), the sister program of Ulysses. 

Inspire has a clean user interface, divided into three large parts: on the left pane, we see a folder structure. Next to it is a list of our already prepared documents, while on the right side, the editing interface fills most of the screen.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_5bd6df3102ab0a12a095458e372d359e.png)

A handy feature is the markdown hot menu, which can be called up with a right click, and then the desired menu can be selected with a single click.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_0d5d3d344d9304af2c2ff8a764bc9bac.png)

Although there is a knowledgebase on the website of Inspire, it is more like a collection of articles about the usage of markdown editors. There is a [markdown cheat sheet](https://www.inspire-writer.com/kb/markdown-cheat-sheet) and another article on [what markdown is and why it should be used](https://www.inspire-writer.com/kb/what-is-markdown).

### 5.3. iA Writer

If you want a cross-platform solution that uses the same interface on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android platforms, [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) is your perfect choice. It started its conquering journey in 2010, and at that time, it was almost the only markdown text editor for anything.

Of course, the number of competitors has grown significantly over the past ten years. However, it was an unavoidable application among cross-platform editors for a very long time until Typora appeared.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_6aef58de37ca7ddfabb7432c03838fc3.png)

### 5.4. Typora

[Typora](https://typora.io/) is a mature text editor that can be used on Windows, macOS and Linux systems. The program was in beta for quite a long time, and anyone could freely download and use it without restrictions. But the final version was released, which is no longer free. 

If you need an excellent texting app with many [built-in themes](https://theme.typora.io/), you should definitely give Typora a try. This program also has a very detailed [help](https://support.typora.io/): if you look at the [export options](https://support.typora.io/Export/), you can see countless solutions for exporting previously written content.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_bf8a31e8fc8e33e740c363ca5df437b5.png)

The screenshot above shows a minimalist theme called Quartz, which is especially useful for documentation, note-taking, and code snippets. Typora supports Math and Academic Functions, and with the built-in mhchem extension, Chemistry Expressions.

### 5.5. Zettlr

Zettlr is a free and open-source markdown application designed for academic writing. The user interface is as follows:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_5ee37473cb8c82be3dcef9d6fe69dd0d.png)

Among other indicators, Zettlr uses [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) to collect the following data about you while using its website:

* User IP address (anonymised: 192.168.xxx.xxx)
* Date and time of the request
* Title of the page being viewed (Page Title)
* URL of the page being viewed (Page URL)
* URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (Referrer URL)
* Screen resolution being used
* Time in local user's timezone
* Files that were clicked and downloaded (Download)
* Links to an outside domain that were clicked (Outlink)
* Pages generation time (the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the webserver and then downloaded by the user: Page speed)
* Location of the user: country, region, city, approximate latitude and longitude (Geolocation)
* Main Language of the browser being used (Accept-Language header)
* User Agent of the browser being used (User-Agent header)

At the bottom of the privacy statement page, you can disable data collection (opt-out) and prevent the Web Analytics tool (Matomo) from storing this data about you.

Zettlr has a very detailed online help in six languages. The online help is written in Zettlr, so by visiting the help, you can get a perfect idea of the application's capabilities.

### 5.6. Notepad++ 

It is a very popular and open-source text editor which can be downloaded and used for free. It is worth knowing that Notepad++ is an editing program prepared to support several programming languages and document types and was primarily designed for programmers.

### 5.7. HedgeDoc

This app was initially created as HackMD; later, HackMD became CodiMD which lived alongside [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) for almost a year until it finally got the name HedgeDoc. It's an [open-source](https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc), web-based, self-hosted markdown editor that lets you easily collaborate on notes, graphs, and presentations in real-time. All you have to do is share your note link with your colleagues, and they're good to go.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_2bf7ebc0bc07b0b88f8288bc0379b675.png)

Its documentation is very detailed: the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/setup/getting-started/), the [Configuration Guide](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/configuration/), the [Developer Guide](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/dev/getting-started/), the [Online Help](https://docs.hedgedoc.org/) and other useful information are all available on the software's website. Besides the FAQ, you may also ask direct questions on Matrix and Discourse.

The company pays particular attention to cybersecurity threats and the dangers of possible data loss.
Previously, a headless instance of Chromium was used to generate PDFs, but this led to some security vulnerabilities and was deactivated. Until this feature is safely implemented again, a workaround should be used to generate PDFs from markdown code.

## 6. What concerns may we have about online markdown editors?

Suppose you are not only interested in how incredible markdown editors are and how easy they are to use but also how reliable they are from a cybersecurity point of view. In that case, there is very little information to be found online.

One such exception is Zettlr's page, where you can read the [privacy statement](https://zettlr.com/privacy/) of the software and find out what data is collected about you and how it is used. However, do not be fooled by the lack of transparency on privacy issues. While most markdown editors do not disclose what data they collect, it is easy to imagine that they collect as much data as Zettlr.

Below we mention some aspects that should be kept in mind to be exposed to the slightest cyber risk when using a markdown editor.

### 6.1. Online or offline?

When choosing a markdown editor, one of the essential questions is whether the given software can only be used online in cyberspace or locally on our computer (even offline). We can undoubtedly say that today everything is available online, and many products are free, which is often helpful and certainly a convenient solution. 

If I am looking for a word or phrase in a specific target language, I'd type it into Google Translate rather than take the dictionary off the shelf. In our fast-paced world, this is almost self-evident, not only because we have become comfortable but also because we have the answer almost in seconds, and we don't have to make a special effort to solve the problem.

However, when using software online, you should keep in mind that it is like working remotely on someone else's computer. However, if you look at online or cloud-based work this way, you may look at this whole thing differently.

There are many online PDF-Word converters on the Internet, which are free and have their limitations in terms of functionality. Sometimes they only work in the free version up to a particular file size. Other times they do not know how to recognise characters. In the latter case, it does not make much sense to use them: by saving the pdf as an image and pasting it into a Word document, the result is often unusable.

Suppose we want to convert a publicly available PDF file into Word format. In that case, there is no major problem since the data we upload to the cloud for conversion already exists elsewhere. If, on the other hand, we were to do the same with personal or company data encrypted online, it would raise many cybersecurity questions.

### 6.2. Is everything about data protection and privacy?

After the examples above, it is easy to see which document we would create with an online markdown editor and in which case, we would rather avoid using an online markdown editor.

Before creating any content using an online application, ask yourself whether you would share your content with the whole world without remorse or concern. Some online markdown editors analyse the text you create and use it to make targeted advertisements.

The phenomenon is not new. Perhaps one of the most glaring examples is Google Ads, which interestingly bombards us with advertisements corresponding to our search (in addition to taking geographical and other factors (often age, gender, and interests) into account).

As we saw in the example of Zettlr, most applications collect data about us and use this data to profile us: where we log in, what device we use to log in, what we do in the application, what pages we visit, etc. These data can be of great value to companies or even individuals (e.g. hackers), as they can use them for marketing and other purposes.

Another example might be Inspire Writer: please read its [privacy policy](https://www.inspire-writer.com/privacy) if you are curious about what information the application obtains and how it is used. The editor can be used in seven different languages.

In the case of online use, we work on another computer in the cloud. The main concern about cloud computing is its security. The problem is that cloud providers are also prime targets for hackers, given the large amount of data they hold.

### 6.3. What about the competition?

Suppose company data is published publicly on the Internet using a markdown editor. In that case, there is a chance that this data will be misused: information related to the company's know-how, strategic objectives or confidential company data might fall into the hands of competitors. 

A data leak can devastate a company's reputation and may cause a much more significant financial loss than technical damage. And while companies and their reputation and customer loyalty are continuously tested, at the same time (because of the GDPR), they are also threatened with severe fines and lawsuits.

On the other hand, it is also possible that leaked company data and the accompanying publicity will benefit a given company. Because of a scandal, the name of the given company might appear on the front page of well-known newspapers. If the leaked data is not related to the company's core business or it is not that important, then this can help a previously anonymous company to get into the spotlight.

This way or the other, a company should become in the spotlight by making its name known through exemplary service, good products and reliability.

### 6.4. How can a text editor be hacked?

For an attack to be successful, an attacker must somehow gain access to a legitimate user account through [phishing](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/phishing-the-most-common-cyberthreat-and-the-everlasting-fight-against-it), [social engineering](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/social-engineering-the-art-of-manipulating-people), or other methods.

Some text editors allow users to run third-party code and use plugins to extend the application's functionality. While this may benefit the users, some [experts say](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-can-abuse-text-editors-privilege-escalation) it can pose security risks.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_f99f36f1755f9f128e629275e17e5646.png)
Text editors can be hacked via third-party plugins – [ThreatPost](https://threatpost.com/researchers-show-how-popular-text-editors-can-be-attacked-via-third-party-plugins/130559/)

*"Depending on the targeted editor, the attacker needs to create specially crafted scripts or package files, and place them in specific plugin directories. In some cases, the hacker may need to create additional files and enable extensions in order for the attack to work, but this should not be difficult if they have access to a less-privileged account." – [Eduard Kovacs](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-can-abuse-text-editors-privilege-escalation)*
