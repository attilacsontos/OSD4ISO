# Why is data backup vital for private entrepreneurs and freelancers?

## 1. The purpose of this article, in brief
This article discusses why it is essential to create a backup, especially for private entrepreneurs and freelancers. 

It is certainly not the first time you have heard that you must back up your data. Everyone has already heard this, yet the data shows that data loss is common and enormous in number despite all this. The topic is multifaceted, so writing about it shortly and purposefully is challenging. 

I want to draw your attention to the fact that this is a short article, the primary purpose of which is to give practical and immediately usable advice to self-employed people regarding data backup. If you are interested in a detailed analysis of data backup methods, I recommend an exhaustive article, [Backup: Digital lifebelt for your irreplaceable files](https://nc3.lu/pages/knowledge/totm/backup.html).

## 2. How severe is the situation?
To get a sense of the gravity of the situation, let’s look at the extracted facts and figures below:

* Every [39 seconds](https://www.dbxuk.com/statistics/cyber-security), there is a cyber attack
* Most companies take nearly [6 months](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/) to detect a data breach
* [95%](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/) of cybersecurity breaches are due to human error
* [4 million files](https://www.dbxuk.com/statistics/cyber-security) are stolen every day – that is 44 every single second
* Only [57 per cent](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf?cmp=120469) of businesses are successful in recovering their data using a backup
* The cost of ransomware is expected to rise to [$265 billion by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/)
* Recovering from a ransomware attack cost businesses [$1.85 million](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/pdfs/whitepaper/sophos-state-of-ransomware-2021-wp.pdf?cmp=120469) on average in 2021
*[ 43%](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/) of cyber attacks target small business
* More than [77%](https://www.cybintsolutions.com/cyber-security-facts-stats/) of organizations do not have a Cyber Security Incident Response Plan

## 3.	Why is the situation so bad, and what can we do about it?
Several events can cause data loss, and no completely secure system and technology exists. Even though data loss is a real event that occurs for several reasons, few people plan and systematically deal with the security of their data treatment. Many regret the extra time required to develop secure data storage and management habits.

In addition to all of this, the amount of data we create and manage is growing exponentially, and as a result, data loss itself is becoming more and more likely to occur.

Just think about how many portals you are registered in, where you create data, work with them and then save them. As an individual entrepreneur, you are most likely connected to several companies whose data you manage and save in different places. Since you are dealing not only with your own data but also with your customers’ data, you must handle this data with particular care, considering the GDPR provisions.

## 4.	What are the possible causes of data loss?

Data loss can happen in several ways, with many causes. There are three main categories of possible causes of data loss as follows:
### 4.1.	Physical, hardware:
* Malfunctioning device (manufacturing defect, type defect)
* Overheating, poor cooling
* Dust, dirt
* Scratches, breaks, bumps
* Moisture and water ingress

### 4.2.	Software
* Application crash
* File system corruption
* Virus attack

### 4.3.	Human factor
* Intentional or incompetent damage
* Ignoring prescribed maintenance and safety rules
* Improper use (accidental deletion)

Creating a backup does not cost much money, nor does it take much time, but it is not only a profitable investment but also a must when you think about the consequences of data loss.

## 5.	How to make a backup of your data, then?

Start with similar principles when planning the data backup procedure and creating your backups. First, you need to consider where your data is, what kind of and how much data you work with.

Considering that it is almost impossible to back up all data, in most cases, it is necessary to define which data are the most important and which are indispensable for the operation of your company. Therefore, you must create a priority queue to list less critical data and data that do not need to be backed up. 

In short, the above means that a risk assessment and business impact analysis must be carried out: what data is essential and what happens in case of data loss classified into different categories.

Then, create a backup plan: how often, with what method and where do you make backups?
For smaller companies, the following points should be taken into account:

* Find out where your data is
* Conduct a risk assessment and business impact analysis
* Create a backup plan
* Follow the 3-2-1 backup policy (redundant backups are key)
* Take advantage of automated backup scheduling
* Encrypt your data before/while backing them up
* Follow privacy laws and keep an eye on regulations
* Treat the above as a process and improve it continuously

The 3-2-1 backup policy

Sole proprietors and freelancers have fewer resources; they are often sole proprietorships, so following a simpler and easier procedure is worth following. In their case, however, they also need to know where their data is, what type and how much data they have, what is vital to them, what is less important and what does not need to be backed up.

If you already know what type and amount of data you want to save, the next step is to decide the backup frequency. The frequency of backups determines how much data you are ‘willing’ to lose in the event of data loss.

It is also essential to decide where to make the backup copy: in the cloud with a storage provider, locally on some data storage, or both.

## 6.	Backup files locally

Local data backup is also called on-site backup. This includes storing data on physical media such as hard drives, external hard drives, flash drives, etc. This backup method is affordable and expands quickly, so it can easily meet the needs of a rapidly growing business. However, as your organization grows, you need to expand your backup media.

Storage devices for local data backup are cheap, easily expandable, simple to use and do not require complicated installation procedures. The biggest disadvantage of the local backup method is that it is prone to security threats such as theft. Since the data is physically either on the computer or on a data carrier, sensitive information about the company and its customers can be stolen if the office is broken into.

Additionally, backups can be damaged by natural disasters, flooding, flooding, etc. and in the worst case, they can even be destroyed, causing irreparable damage to your company.

Knowing all this, it can be stated that in addition to local backup copies, another backup procedure is absolutely necessary: either data storage in another location (the data storage is stored in another closed location and the data is saved there with a specified regularity) or data storage in the cloud is also necessary.

## 7.	Bacup files to the cloud

Remote backup involves storing data on an online server. For example, the servers of cloud-based backup solutions are geographically separated from the physical locations of clients. Companies can subscribe to services for a fee, which may vary from provider to provider. It is worth comparing the quality of the services, the price, the rules for storing backup copies and more before choosing a service provider. If you don’t work with a lot of data, you can also choose a free version, but you can only store a small amount of data there (usually 5GB is the limit).

One of the most obvious solutions is to use your operating system to make a backup copy of the contents of certain designated folders from time to time.

On Windows, use the Windows Backup to backup your folders, apps, settings or credentials. On a Mac, follow the below link and choose whether you want to use the Time Machine or iCloud Drive. Please follow the below links to get the detailed explanation.

When creating a backup, you can choose what you want to copy to the cloud. The system usually offers the Desktop, the Documents and Pictures folders for this purpose.

Consider creating a ‘Personal Vault’, where you can store sensitive data. The personal vault is actually an encrypted folder inside One Drive. After logging in to One Drive, another identification is required, or you need to verify the code received via SMS or in some other way that you are authorized to open the safe.

Physically separating backup copies from original files protects documents from various risks such as theft and natural disasters. Another big advantage of remote data backup solutions is that they have encryption capabilities. This allows files to be secured and reduces the chance of retrieving leaked data in the event of data loss.

Another benefit of remote backup is that these providers offer unlimited storage capacity. Therefore, you don’t have to worry about the disk space being full.

While remote backup provides unlimited and safe data storage, you have to calculate the monthly subscription fee, which can be a disqualifying factor for companies with tight budgets. 

Another disadvantage of remote backup is that you need an internet connection to upload and download files

## 8.	Conclusions

Both local and remote data backup solutions have advantages and disadvantages. However, if you can afford the infrastructure to support remote backup, this is an excellent solution.

Of course, there is no need to overcomplicate things: perhaps the most important thing is that the data is saved regularly (at specified intervals) and at least in two copies (in addition to local saving, e.g. to a flash drive or external drive and to the cloud).
