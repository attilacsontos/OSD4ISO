# Backup strategies for self-employed individuals

In today's digital landscape, safeguarding your data is non-negotiable. As a self-employed professional, the loss of critical information can be detrimental to your business. Establishing a robust backup system is not just a precaution; it's a must.

Creating a backup strategy is crucial for safeguarding your valuable information as a self-employed individual. There are various methods and tools available to ensure continuous and reliable backups. This is a concise guide outlining fundamental approaches.

## 1.	Before you do anything
Before making a backup copy, follow the steps below, and think about what you would like to make a backup copy of (which are the files you do not want to lose under any circumstances, either for legal requirements or personal reasons). Then, get to know the principles and methods of making backup copies so that you can choose the most suitable for you.

1. Delete any unnecessary files from your computer.
2.	Organize the remaining files into folders (subfolders if necessary) so you can access them as easily and quickly as possible and have a better overview of your work processes.
3.	Decide which folders (containing files) you will continue to back up at regular intervals in the future.
4.	Decide which method to choose for making backup copies (where and with what method you make copies).

If you have completed the above, you can choose the proper method according to your circumstances. You can choose a more straightforward method if little or no sensitive data needs to be handled. 

However, in today's world, the scenario is much more common when you have to work with a lot of sensitive data that you must take care of and often have to solve the inviolability of specific files based on legal requirements.

## 2.	Basic techniques that must be done to protect your data

**1. USB drives**
The most basic, obvious and simplest way to make a backup copy of your data is to use a USB drive. At the same time, however, this is the weakest, least reliable method, so instead of using one USB, take a step further and use two to make this method more secure. 

The process must follow the basic principles of creating backup copies (backups must be stored at different places and times), which requires at least two USB drives.

**2.	External hard drives**
Invest in external hard drives for local backups. Connect these drives to your system regularly, do a manual backup (copy the folders to the hard drive), overwrite the 'old' files on the hard drive, or save them with an updated timestamp (the date of your backup creation).

To protect your files against physical damage (fire, flood, flooding, etc.) and theft, keep the hard drive away (in a physically separate location) from your computer.

**3. Cloud backups**
You can also store your files with different cloud providers as backup copies. Depending on how much data is involved, you have to choose a storage space of the right size, and then you can manually copy your files there at regular intervals and overwrite the existing files.

**4. Set up notifications**
Regularity (making backup copies at certain intervals) is of crucial importance. In principle, you can lose as much data as has been created or changed since the last backup copy. 

If you decide not to automate the process, set up a notification on your phone or put a reminder in your calendar to get an automatic notification when you need to make a backup copy. Even if you do not have a backup plan, creating a continuous backup at certain intervals is critical to protecting your data.

## 3.	More advanced techniques that must be done to protect your data

If you use even one of the methods described above, you have already taken a giant step towards keeping your data safe. Of course, you can do much more than the above to ensure your data is safe. 
One direction in developing the procedure is to try to automate the creation of the backup copy more and more, which can be a huge burden off your shoulders.

The other direction is to improve software protection: you can use version control software (with the help of which you can implement secure version tracking), antivirus software to prevent data phishing and data leakage, or software that can be used to encrypt your sensitive or critical files and thus make a backup copy of them.

**1. External Hard Drives**
Connect your external hard drives to your system regularly (each Monday/Friday or as per your schedule) and use backup software to automate the process. 

To protect your files against physical damage (fire, flood, flooding, etc.) and theft, keep the hard drive away (in a physically separate location) from your computer.

**2. Network-Attached Storage (NAS)**
Set up a network-attached storage system (NAS) for centralized and easily accessible storage. It allows you to create a private cloud that provides convenient remote access while maintaining the security of your local storage. Be sure to schedule routine backups to your NAS device. 

**3. Automated Cloud Backups**
Take advantage of cloud services for automatic and continuous backups. Platforms like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive offer seamless integration with your devices. Set up automatic synchronization so your files are continuously updated in the cloud.

**4. Version Control Systems**
When creating much content (where many versions of these documents are created during patching or development), version control systems like Git or SVN can be invaluable. They track changes over time, providing a detailed history and the option to revert to previous states if necessary.

**5. Ransomware Protection**
Ransomware attacks are one of the most significant risks of permanently losing your data. Protect yourself against these attacks with robust antivirus software and regular operating system updates. Learn about phishing tactics and be careful with email attachments or links to prevent malicious software from compromising your data.

**6. Encryption for Sensitive Data**
Prioritize the encryption of sensitive information. Whether in transit or storage, encryption adds an extra layer of security. Use tools like BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) to encrypt entire drives.

## 4.	Perfect your backup techniques

There are two more ways to improve the creation of a backup copy: the first is to combine the above methods and use several solutions simultaneously (external drive, cloud, NAS, etc.)

The second option is to improve existing methods by performing tests, auditing, continuous learning, or documenting and improving existing processes.

**1. Redundancy for Mission-Critical Data**
For crucial files, consider redundant backup solutions. Use a combination of cloud services, external drives, and NAS to ensure multiple layers of protection.

**2. Regular Audits and Testing**
Conduct periodic audits of your backup systems. Ensure that files are being backed up correctly and test your restoration process. This proactive approach helps identify potential issues before they become critical.

**3. Documentation and Organization**
Maintain a clear and organized structure for your data. Properly label and categorize files, making it easier to locate and restore specific information. Document your backup procedures for reference in case of emergencies.

**4. Continuous Learning**
Stay informed about evolving technologies and best practices. Regularly update your backup strategy to incorporate the latest advancements and address emerging threats.

By implementing these methods, you can establish a resilient data backup system, providing peace of mind and ensuring that your business operations remain uninterrupted, even in the face of unforeseen challenges.
