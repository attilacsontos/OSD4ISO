# Why use GitHub for collaboration?

GitHub, hailed as the globe's largest code repository, is tailored for public use. It offers an array of collaborative features, including Wikis and integrated bug tracking. Functioning as both a code repository and a social network, GitHub hosts a multitude of open-source projects.

In the realm of development, the adoption of public source code control has become widespread. GitHub, which is built upon Git, facilitates teams in the creation and sharing of software. Git serves as the powerhouse behind distributed version control and source management, while GitHub enhances its capabilities through a web-based GUI layered atop it.

The GitHub platform revolves around promoting public exposure for your code and fostering collaboration. As a member, you gain access to a network of other GitHub users. Users can manage entire projects, and developers can connect with each other.

Moreover, developers can request contribution privileges beyond their own, enabling collaborative development. A central feature of GitHub is the forking or copying of entire code repositories from one account to another, allowing individuals to build new projects on top of existing open-source solutions.

Git encourages the documentation of small code changes, enabling developers to understand how previous programmers tackled challenging issues. However, collaboration extends beyond developers and code storage; any document or group of documents can be versioned. Consequently, GitHub is evolving and attracting non-developer users, offering them a platform for collaborative work.

The purpose of the OSD4ISO project is to show and demonstrate, from the perspective of non-developers, how to collaborate on content development and how we can take advantage of the features and countless opportunities provided by GitHub to make collaboration as simple as possible and to create better quality content together.

## 1. Possible methods of collaborative writing on GitHub

Collaborating on writing projects using GitHub can be a powerful way to work together efficiently, track changes, and manage versions. There are two ways for authors to collaborate on content on GitHub. 

### 1.1.	Using Git and GitHub for collaboration

One way is to use Git (either by creating the content there or copying it from GitHub to the local machine) and the changes are sent to the repository on GitHub using Git. This is perhaps the most widespread method since most people use Git for version tracking and content (or code) development. It allows us to work locally, on a machine, without depending on being constantly online.

### 1.2.	Using only GitHub for collaboration

GitHub's user interface allows authors to collaborate on content development using only GitHub without any application installed on their machine. Some content creators like using Git, while others prefer making changes directly to the GitHub user interface. 

Exclusive collaboration on GitHub has two possible options depending on whether you have access to the particular repository you want to modify or not.

* Forking a repo (you do not have write access)

If you do not have write access to a repository, you must fork it to be able to modify it. By forking a repo, you make a copy of it on GitHub. You can then make changes and create a pull request to offer your modifications to be accepted by the owner of the repository.

This way, forking allows you to modify projects without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository.

* Making direct changes as a contributor (you have write access)

If the owner of the repository invites you to collaborate on a project, you can become a contributor who can make changes directly within the repository. 

The owner of the repository can still create settings that can be used to monitor your proposed changes and the merge will only be created (the changes you offer will only be part of the repository) if the owner of the repository accepts your changes.

It is entirely up to you whether you send us the pull request related to the project via GitHub or Git installed on your machine.
