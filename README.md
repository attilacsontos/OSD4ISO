# OSD4ISO (Open Security Documentation for Individuals and Small Organisations)

## This project aims to build community-centred documentation for freelancers, remote workers, and SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) workers to help them securely and safely operate online.

Individuals and SOHO workers are as exposed to online risks as anyone else. However, they often lack the resources to afford the security solutions and services available to more resourced entities.

In this project, you will find practical guides designed to help you operate specific solutions necessary for remote work and interactions in a way that reduces the cyber risks you face.

Starting and operating a remote activity is inherently demanding, as it requires learning to operate many new solutions and technologies. Consequently, there is often a trade-off in terms of time and resources invested, with security not being prioritized as it is perceived as less urgent. However, cybersecurity is essential to ensure the success of a business, regardless of the industry in which the company operates.

Creating relevant documentation through a platform such as GitHub is intended to open the resource to the community and ensure it benefits from the contributions of all interested participants. This is particularly critical for relevance, accuracy, and keeping the information up to date.

Regarding the tools or solutions to be documented, the primary focus will be on well-known open-source applications, as they have proven to be robust, secure, and benefit from the engagement of a strong community. 

Therefore, we ask all freelancers, telecommuters, and SOHO workers who recognize the importance of cybersecurity and want to help their peers to actively participate in the development of the project and make suggestions for the development of additional topics and the improvement of existing ones. 

Do not hesitate to take an active part in this project and share your experiences and knowledge, so that the content of the platform remains as helpful as possible for those who are just starting this type of activity, lack information and technical skills, but are eager to learn and develop.
