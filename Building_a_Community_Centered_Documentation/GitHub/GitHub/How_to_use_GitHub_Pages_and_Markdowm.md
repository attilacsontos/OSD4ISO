# How to use GitHub Pages and Markdown together?

Combining GitHub pages with Markdown is a powerful way to showcase your projects or easily create documentation. GitHub Pages lets you host static websites directly from your GitHub repository, while Markdown provides a simple but versatile syntax for formatting text. 

By leveraging the two tools together, you can easily create and publish professional-looking websites, README files, project documentation, and more. In this guide, we'll explore how to leverage the synergy between GitHub Pages and Markdown to improve your project presentation and documentation workflow.

## 1.	Why use markdown to push content to GitHub?

There are many reasons to use Markdown to submit content to GitHub. Considering that the joint project deals with written content rather than codes, it is obvious to use a format that can be easily used in several applications (Markdown editors) and GitHub is also able to interpret it. Let's take a look at the most important arguments for using markdown in relation to GitHub, as follows:

* **Simple syntax**: Markdown has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn and write. It uses plain text formatting to mark headings, lists, links, and other elements, making it easy to create and edit content without writing HTML.

* **Integration with documentation**: Many software projects hosted on GitHub use Markdown for documentation. By using Markdown for your content, you can seamlessly integrate it with your project's repository, making it easier for contributors and users to find and access documentation alongside your code.

* **Readability**: Markdown makes text more readable, both raw and rendered.

* **Easy to learn**: It is simple and intuitive, so others can easily understand the content.

* **Version contro**l: GitHub is primarily a version control platform, and Markdown files are plain text files that can be easily tracked and managed using Git. This allows for collaborative editing, history tracking, and easy rollback of changes. 

* **GitHub rendering**: GitHub automatically renders Markdown files in a readable format directly in the browser. This makes it easy to view and review content on GitHub without having to open separate editors or viewers. 

* **Support for static site generators**: Markdown is often used in conjunction with static site generators such as Jekyll, or Gatsby. These generators can convert Markdown files to HTML so you can create entire websites from Markdown content. When you host your content on GitHub Pages, it provides a convenient way to publish and maintain websites directly from your GitHub repository.

* **Wide adoption**: Markdown is widely used on various platforms, not just GitHub. Once you learn Markdown, you can use it in other contexts, such as writing emails, creating documents, or even publishing on the web.

In addition to the above, markdown is a lightweight and versatile markup language that fits well with the workflows and features provided by GitHub, making it a popular choice for pushing content to GitHub repositories.

## 2.	How can you push content created in Markdown to GitHub?

There are several ways to push markdown files to GitHub. You can either create Markdown files directly in your repository or upload existing Markdown files. In both cases, however, you need a GitHub account and a repository where you can write the content written in Markdown or send it there. After that, let's look at an example of the workflow, as follows:

1. **Create a GitHub account**: If you do not have one already, sign up for an account.

1. **Create a new repository**: After logging into GitHub, navigate to your profile and click on the ‘Repositories’ tab. Then click ‘New’ to create a new repository. Name your repository, optionally add a description, and choose to make it public or private.

3.	**Create or upload Markdown files**:
    * To create a new Markdown file in GitHub, click the ‘Add File’ button and select the ‘Create New File’ dropdown menu. Name the file with .md extension and you can start writing and editing in Markdown format.
    * You can also create markdown files in any of the markdown editors (for example, by using Visual Studio Code). Once created your file, you can push the content by using the editor (if you ‘linked your editor with your GitHub repository). Alternatively, you can upload the file from within GitHub by clicking on the ‘Add file’ button and selecting the option ‘Upload files’.
1. **Commit your changes**: Once you have created or uploaded your Markdown files, you need to commit them to your repository. Write a brief description of the changes you have made in the 'Commit changes' section and click on the 'Commit changes' button.
1. **View your conten**t: After committing your changes, your Markdown files will be visible in your repository. You can navigate to your repository's URL to view them.

GitHub automatically renders Markdown files in a readable format, making it easy to share and collaborate on Markdown-based content. You can also use GitHub's built-in features like branches, pull requests, and issues to manage and collaborate on your Markdown content.
