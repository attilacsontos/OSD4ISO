# How to install Thunderbird?

This step-by-step guide shows how to install Thunderbird on a Windows operating system.

## 1. What is Thunderbird?

Thunderbird is a free and open-source email, chat, and calendar client that is easy to set up and customize. One of the main principles of Thunderbird is the use and promotion of open standards. As an open-source project, anyone can contribute and share their ideas, designs, code, and time to help other users.

## 2. How to install Thunderbird?

Navigate to the website of Thunderbird (https://www.thunderbird.net/) and click on the 'Download' button.

The process starts, and in your Downloads folder, you should be able to see the package:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_dd89c10891348d07d0a31413996471b5.png)

Double-click on it so the set-up wizard appears:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_a971b43cee8e7ce1d0240c49af7d8b0f.png)

Click 'Next >' and choose a set-up type (Standard or Custom):

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_665a1db359d05ea9e4f9af7f67a27bfe.png)

After you have made your decision and clicked on the 'Next >' button, the Summary window appears. Here, you can see the location where Thunderbird is installed on your hard drive, and you can decide whether you want Thunderbird to become your default mail application. Click 'Install' to continue:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c4c5e80326e13e2b75cf67993f67f63e.png)

The window that appears as the last step of the installation informs you that Mozilla Thunderbird has been installed on your computer, and you can start the application by clicking on the 'Finish' button: 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_be91c3faa3e15030b59dbde92472f593.png)

As the next step, the 'Set Up Your Existing Email Address' window appears. Please fill out the fields and choose a strong password. If you already have an email address (for example, in the Zimbra email client), use the same password and login (email address), so Thunderbird can check and set up your account. Click on 'Continue':

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_3d634959510e83c0dc1e65783a0c38a9.png)

Thunderbird probes the email server and auto-populates some fields, as can be seen in the below screenshot:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_53c2edfb23d3c5d967be3874e19a5406.png)


Please use ’mail.mbox.lu’ as the Hostname. Click on 'Re-test' (if necessary), so Thunderbird can check the settings on the given mail server (mail.mbox.lu). The checkmark and the message on a green background show that the test was successful, Thunderbird found the ports of the incoming and outgoing servers, and the communication is settled. Click on 'Done'.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_be28ed8b7bcefe01bd9fa245d07edf94.png)

Please note that the configuration may change. Please contact the Helpdesk at sysadmin@lhc.lu for further information if your settings do not work.

The new window informs you that your account has been successfully created. Besides this vital information, you can modify your account settings, add a signature to your emails, and create end-to-end encryption.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_302d1971c594c8ba1aa0b619e1eb307a.png)

Please click on 'Finish', so your Thunderbird instance opens with the below popup:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_62d01b8ea7e84ab7cd14a4bd74dfcae4.png)

As the last step of the installation, you can set Thunderbird as the default client for your email, newsgroup, feeds and calendar. You can make these settings default (by checking or unchecking the relevant checkbox and clicking on ' Set as default'). Alternatively, you can choose 'Skip integration' if you do not want these options.

# Thunderbird UI Personalisation

This article was written to collect the experiences and unique features you can use to customise the Thunderbird email system according to your taste easily. This content can be beneficial for readers who are new to the Thunderbird email program and want to use similar settings that they were used to in the previous email system.

## 1.	Thunderbird Look & Feel

By using themes, you can change Thunderbird's look and feel dramatically. Choose the menu 'Tools' and the submenu 'Add-ons and Themes'.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_1d2cb3b056aeb2a3b3c117257f602a4d.png)

The Add-ons manager appears. Click on the option 'Themes' on the left to see which Themes are enabled and disabled on your Thunderbird instance (The System theme – auto is the default theme). You can enable the Light or the Dark themes.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_b012c08ff756bc1fc84e2b9b059d00fd.png)


Besides the ‘Light’or the default ‘Auto’ themes, you can also choose the ‘Dark’ colour scheme, which is perhaps more soothing to the eyes:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_cc49b898de96e2b2ae351ee08929abf3.png)

In case you want to use a different theme, use the search bar in the top right-hand corner of the screen, and so you can search among thousands of themes on https://addons.thunderbird.net/ : 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_9ea461dd26d2bdc8094db4ba630ad44e.png)

I typed 'blue' in the search bar and got 153 matching results for that term:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_73241b5eb15a916f1559424550dd4336.png)

You can also get numerous extensions and collections besides themes on the same sites.

## 2.	Creating folders and subfolders

To create a folder, right-click 'Inbox' and choose 'New folder…' from the dropdown menu.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c414f0dd3c4373c691f32c72b8a6e19f.png)

After you have created the folders in the Inbox folder, it is possible to create subfolders. To do this, you must select the folder for which you want to create a subfolder and, similarly to creating a folder, right-click and name the subfolder to be created.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_680e8ae88c120b1eafa7b40f10e17fd8.png)

## 3.	Colour-coding the subfolders:

Right-click on the name of the folder/subfolder and choose 'Properties' from the dropdown menu. The ‘Folder Properties’ window opens, where you can set (among many other things) the icon colour of the folder (circled in red in the below screenshot).

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_d8f9d55bf64013027f4d3b0cfc5b5ce0.png)

To change the colour of the folder, click on the icon colour and from the icon colour palette, choose a colour you wish to use and click OK.

If you have a Zimbra account and want the same folder structure, please use the same subfolder names (otherwise, your folders will not synchronise and remain empty).

Please also note that when you 'move' the subfolder from the 'Local Folders' to the 'Inbox', it is just copied and not moved (that is, you need to delete the empty folder from the 'Local Folders').

## 4.	Tabbed Email

Tabbed emails let you load emails into separate tabs (you can keep multiple emails open) so you can quickly switch between them, making your work easier and faster. This feature can be especially handy if you need to collect information related to the reply email from several emails.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_16ab88ae09fdbef8504d952b941ce9c9.png)

Alternatively, double-click the chosen email to open it in a new tab.

## 5.	Threaded and Unthreaded view

These two views (or sorting of emails) can influence the speed of your work significantly. 

### Threaded View

Choose the option 'View – Sort by – Threaded' as can be seen in the below screenshot:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_572593c175fbac4355d7404c50f460b0.png)

If you are using the threaded view, Thunderbird groups messages in a tree-like structure by conversations:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_10d98acce51d92bf3cc648455642e627.png)

Threading is useful for displaying your messages if you want to keep your messages grouped by conversation. This view can speed up your response time if you need to respond to a mail with many people replying to various conversation messages.

### Unthreaded View

Choose the option 'View – Sort by – Unthreaded' as can be seen in the below screenshot:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_a90daa48b419c1628d9229771790f2b6.png)

This is the view when you do not want to group your emails by conversations. Some people may find this view more straightforward than the threaded one.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_97d698ea6f53340b1c21583d4f1272d8.png)

The emails are much easier to see in this view. However, this view can be used successfully if we do not have long conversations with our contacts but only email certain people. We do not need the option to be able to quickly search back in a long email thread with many participants to find out who answered what to whom and when.

## 6.	How to create a calendar in Thunderbird?

Go to the Calendar icon (or press Alt+3) so your 'Home' calendar will appear. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_156370c82f78bc454559ac450655d239.png)

It is a default and empty calendar you get when you install Thunderbird, but you can create and name your own calendars the way you like.

Click on the 'New Calendar' (+) button to create a new calendar. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_125fdebe956d4dfc787c2f153f2ba429.png)

The 'Create a New Calendar' wizard opens. Choose where you want to create your calendar (locally, on your computer, or on the network). If you want to access your calendar remotely or share it with someone (your friends, contacts, co-workers, etc.), choose the option 'On the Network'.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_1f656f70db64635f48803bd539808c39.png)

## 7.	Signatures

### Plain-text signatures

To create your signature in Thunderbird's Account Settings interface, click on your Inbox icon, then in the top right-hand corner, choose the 'Display the Thunderbird Menu' hamburger icon:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c456446a8d78f073a5a20896215d0f24.png)

From the dropdown menu, click on 'Account Settings'. In the signature field, type your desired signature, which will appear in text format in all your reply letters and outgoing letters:

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_aa8b47766a1040844bea6f74d144eaf1.png)

Plain text signatures work with messages formatted both in HTML and in text. 

### HTML signatures

To use HTML formatting in your signature, check 'Use HTML' and format the Signature text with the desired HTML markup.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_a8fe6041fb2668f346f5dbaef69a3a91.png)

Please note that if you have an HTML-formatted signature, the message recipient must be able to view HTML-formatted messages in their email program. If they have disabled this ability, the signature will be rendered in text format, and images will not be displayed.

### Custom signatures

You can also create custom signatures by uploading a file that contains your signature. Check the 'Attach the signature from a file instead' checkbox and click 'Choose...' to select the file. The file can contain either plain or HTML-formatted text.

## 8.	Phishing protection

Thunderbird uses its built-in [scam detection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/thunderbirds-scam-detection) mechanisms that are part of the junk filtering functions. Besides, Thunderbird also warns you if you click on a link in a message that appears to take you to a different website than the URL in the message indicates:

Go to the Menu 'Tools' and submenu 'Settings':

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_5e0e29e82769ddd85433a58a41b55465.png)

In the Settings window, choose the 'Privacy and Security' option on the left, scroll to the 'Security' section on the main pane, and check your 'Scam detection' settings. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_4e591165facf5e180ca18691f435916b.png)
