# A Beginner’s Guide of Risk Assessment of Online Applications for SOHOs and Freelancers

You must be very busy if you are a self-employed person or a freelancer. It is also very likely that your business is worth every penny to you, and definitely, you would do everything to ensure that your business survives, flourishes and develops.

It happens very often that entrepreneurs specialise in a specific area; they want to develop, be successful and make a profit in it, and for them, cybersecurity is either unknown or not understood, but it is by no means a prioritised area.

The task of this short article is to help you with what you should pay attention to in the case of online applications, what dangers you may face, how you can assess these dangers in the context of a risk assessment and what steps you should take to ensure that your business in the online space to exist safely.

## 1.	What is cybersecurity risk assessment?

A cybersecurity risk assessment is an evaluation of the maturity of an organisation's ability to protect its information and information systems against cyber threats. It is a systematic appraisal of a company's information systems and processes to 
* identify vulnerabilities
* assess threats able to exploit these vulnerabilities.
* evaluate the effectiveness of the required security controls.

Security control is “A safeguard or countermeasure prescribed for an information system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information and to meet a set of defined security requirements” – [NIST Definition](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_controls).

## 2.	What is the goal of a security assessment?

A security assessment aims to improve a business's overall security posture by addressing vulnerabilities and mitigating risks to protect against potential security breaches or incidents.

## 3.	Why is it important?

Without performing a cybersecurity risk assessment, you do not know how safe your data is, what data you should protect, and how you should protect it, and because of this, your data is already at risk.

In our increasingly digitalised world, small and private businesses face unique challenges in safeguarding their operations against cyber threats. Cybersecurity risk management is crucial to protect sensitive data, maintain customer trust, and ensure business continuity.

## 4.	Fundamental principles of information security: the “CIA Triad”

Now you know the basics and why it is essential to do them. Still, your most critical question is how to do security assessment. In order to understand this, you need to familiarise yourself with the three principles of information security.

In order to carry out a cybersecurity risk assessment, you must first think about where your data is, what kind and amount of data you work with and how you manage your data in the company during its reception, processing, storage and backup. 

If you already have information about these, then the three fundamental principles of information security (CIA Triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability) will be useful for performing a security assessment, in which they will be used as references.

* **Confidentiality** (only authorised persons should have access to data) - your data should remain confidential and should not fall into the possession of those to whom it does not belong. Confidentiality measures are designed to prevent unauthorised access to sensitive information.

* **Integrity** (immutability of data) - The accuracy and immutability of the data must be preserved throughout its entire life cycle. The data cannot be unknowingly modified during transmission, and steps must be taken to ensure that it cannot be modified by unauthorised persons - for example, in a data protection incident.

* **Availability**  (accessibility to your data) - Your data must be consistently and easily accessible to the parties entitled to it.

Your elementary decisions regarding information security are determined by who you allow to access your data (confidentiality), whether you allow anyone to modify your data and if you can identify unplanned modifications of the data (integrity), and how capable you are of making your data permanently accessible (availability).

## 5.	How to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment?

Risk assessment should be an ongoing process: it is not enough to do it once, but it should be done regularly such as once a year, or triggered for every significant change of the system.

For example, if you start using a new online application, you should assess, based on the basic principles of the CIA Triad, whether the intended usage is going to generate significant risks for the data that will be processed by this online tool.

Please follow these steps to perform a cybersecurity risk assessment:

### 5.1.	 Identify your assets

* List all the applications and devices (computers, smartphones, tablets) you use for your business.
* Take note of the data you store, such as customer information, financial records, or any sensitive business data.

### 5.2.	Understand the potential exposure of your assets

* Consider what kind of vulnerabilities and threats your information system might face. 
* A vulnerability is defined as “A flaw or weakness in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exercised (accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited) and result in a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy”. (NIST definition).
* A threat is “any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets or individuals through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.” (NIST definition).
* Practically this means looking for weaknesses that can be exploited by specific threat sources in the context of the foreseen assets usage.
* You should evaluate how likely these damaging events could occur, This can be done with a very simple qualitative scale such as: not likely, moderatly liklely, and highly likely.

### 5.3.	Evaluate the possible impact and damage

* Identify the most likely scenarios in which the weknesses would be exploited, and what would be the consequences for your organisation (financial loss, reputational impact, adversarial decision by a regulation authority, etc).

### 5.4.	Identify the most critical risks and corresponding assets

* The events that are very likely and generating an unbearable damage to the organisation, or to essential assets, should be deemed as critical and prioritized for the deployment of sufficient counter-measures.

### 5.5.	Assess the existence and maturity of the needed security controls

* For each identified risk, document the existence or absence of security controls mitigating the given risk.
* If there are security controls in place, try to evaluate how mature they are and to which extent they contribute to reduce the risk.

### 5.6.	For critical assets, decide if the existing controls are sufficient

* It can be done simply by asking if they would prevent a disaster to occur in case the asset would undergo a known threat.

### 5.7.	Document your findings

* Record the outcome of your work, and the steps you took.
* Make sure you have an action plan defined for each of the critical risks, and more generally for the implementation of the most needed security controls.

### 5.8.	Compare with past assessments and consider if there is progress or not

* This will allow you to identify the main and most difficult gaps on your security posture.
* It will allow demonstrate, in case of incident, that you weren’t negligent and had already taken action to ensure your information system is properly protected.

### 5.9.	Consider asking for professional help

* If you feel overwhelmed or want additional assistance, consider hiring a cybersecurity professional or using online tools designed for small businesses.

Do not forget that these steps provide only a basic foundation for improving your cybersecurity. Regularly revisiting and updating your security measures is essential as technology and threats evolve. Taking these simple steps can significantly enhance the security of your business data.

## 6.	Grow your cybersecurity capabilities

* Familiarise yourself with common cybersecurity practices and tools
* Start by focusing on those controls that you identified as missing for the most critical assets during the risk assessment
* Examples of usual controls that should be deployed:
    * Data backups
    * Update processes for software
    * Usage of secure passwords, and strong authentication where needed
    * Secure network (including Wifi) infrastructure

## 7.	Special care with online applications

If you use online applications, use them with great care: as they are running on someone else's computer and the data you share or use could possibly be seen or accessed by anyone. 

When you start using an online application, you should find out what kind of data you should share or work with while using it.

You can use the three pillars of the CIA Triad as a framework to perform a quick assessment:

* **Confidentiality**: Is it an issue if the data I am pushing to the online application accidentally or intentionnally become exposed to the public?
    * If yes: is it a critical issue, or is it an issue that can be dealt with?
    * In the second case, am I prepared to deal with the issue?
    
* **Integrity**: Is it an issue if the data get modified without my knowledge, and not in the way the application is supposed to transform / process them?
    * If yes: is it a critical issue, or is it an issue that can be dealt with?
    * In the second case, am I prepared to deal with the issue?

* **Availability**: Is it an issue if I cannot access the data sent to the online application, the outcome of their processing by the online application, or the online application itself?
    * If yes: is it a critical issue, or is it an issue that can be dealt with?
    * In the second case, am I prepared to deal with the issue?

## 8.	Conclusions, final thoughts	

Risk assessment is only part of the big picture of Risk Management: how to deal with risk/s.

It is of fundamental importance to understand that even though you are diligent in implementing security controls, there will always be emergint threats that can still impact your information system. Therefore, the first and most crucial step is to check what and how much data you have and prioritise which data you cannot afford to lose (this data must be protected in every way, under all circumstances).

If you recognise the most critical data you must protect under all circumstances and know where they are located, you are in a much better position regarding protecting these data.

This article aims to raise awareness: as an individual entrepreneur, you should ask yourself these basic questions, try to answer them, and, based on this, start towards a safer online space.

Hopefully, you have already realised that a successful business does not exist today without a secure online presence and data security.
