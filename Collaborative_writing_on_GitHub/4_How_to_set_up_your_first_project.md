# 4. How to set up your first project?

**To create a functional project, follow the steps below:**

1. Set up a remote repository on GitHub to create your first project (by project admin). 
2.	Link your local repository (clone a repo) to the remote repository (by the collaborator).
3.	Push changes to add your local files to the remote repository (by the collaborator).
4.	Review the pull request and merge the new content to the repository (by project admin).
5.	Fetch any changes that have happened in the repository and pull those changes onto your local machine (by the collaborator).
6.	If you want to collaborate more, please follow the procedure from step 3 (by the collaborator).

The below workflow shows each step. You may also create an open-source repo on GitHub and others may collaborate with your repository (in that case, you would be the project admin).

## Set up a remote repo

Go to the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) website, create an account, or log in to your existing one. Go to the Home of GitHub (GitHub Dashboard) and click on the Create New Repository button:

Give a name to your repository and provide a short description. GitHub checks whether the repo name is available or not. Then, decide whether you want to create a public (anyone on the Internet can see your repo) or a private repository (you can choose who can see and commit to your repository):

Adding a Readme file to your repository is always a good idea. This Markdown file will be your ‘business card’ to other GitHub users, where you can provide a longer description of your project (so when you share your private or public project with others, they will understand what it does and how it works). 

Click the ‘Create repository’ button to generate your first remote repo on GitHub.

You created your first repository on GitHub, congratulations!
