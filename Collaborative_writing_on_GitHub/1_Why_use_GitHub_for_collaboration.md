# Why use GitHub for collaboration?

GitHub offers an array of collaborative features, including Wikis and integrated bug tracking. Functioning as both a code repository and a social network, GitHub hosts a multitude of open-source projects.

In the realm of development, the adoption of public source code control has become widespread. GitHub, which is built upon the open-source revision control system Git, facilitates teams in the creation and sharing of software. Git serves as the powerhouse behind distributed version control and source management, while GitHub enhances its capabilities through a web-based GUI layered atop it.

The GitHub platform revolves around promoting public exposure for your code and fostering collaboration. As a member, you gain access to a network of other GitHub users. Users can manage entire projects, and developers can connect with each other.

Moreover, developers can request contribution privileges beyond their own, enabling collaborative development. A central feature of GitHub is the forking or copying of entire code repositories from one account to another, allowing individuals to build new projects on top of existing open-source solutions.

Git encourages the documentation of small code changes, enabling developers to understand how previous programmers tackled challenging issues. However, collaboration extends beyond developers and code storage. Any document or group of documents in text format can be versioned. Consequently, GitHub is evolving and attracting non-developer users, offering them a platform for collaborative work.

The purpose of the OSD4ISO project is to show and demonstrate, from the perspective of non-developers, how to collaborate on content development and how we can take advantage of the features and countless opportunities provided by GitHub to make collaboration as simple as possible and to create better quality content together. It will focus on a specific topic : how to make safer the operations of individuals such as remote workers or freelancers.  In particular, this collaborative approach should help to tackle one of the most pervasive issues of online documentation, which is the ability to keep it up-to-date in an ever evolving technological environment.
