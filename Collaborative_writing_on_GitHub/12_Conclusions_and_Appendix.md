# 12. Conclusions and Appendix

## 1. Conclusions

Writers can use very different workflows to collaborate on GitHub. Some use Git, others use version control software or a markdown editor to edit content.

The same change can be achieved in many different ways and methods, so in a README file for a repository that assumes collaborative work, it is worth laying the foundations of who has what responsibility in what way and under what conditions changes are accepted or rejected, for example.

But this way or the other, by leveraging GitHub's web interface and features, writers can seamlessly collaborate on writing projects without needing to use Git commands locally. The entire workflow, from creating branches to merging changes, can be managed within the GitHub platform.

## 2. Appendix

* **[README](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes)**: You can add a README file to the repository to provide important information about the project: why it is useful, what people can do with it, and how they can use it.
* **[Gitignore](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files)**: You can create a .gitignore file in your repository's root directory to specify to Git which files and directories to disregard when committing changes. By committing the .gitignore file to your repository, you ensure that the ignore rules are shared with others who clone the repository.
* **[License](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)**: To ensure that your repository is genuinely open source, it is essential to license it. Open-source licenses enable others to freely use, modify, and distribute the project in your repository. Therefore, the licenses in the repository are essential to facilitate the contribution of others.
* **[Code of conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)**: A code of conduct establishes procedures for resolving conflicts between your project's community members. It also sets forth guidelines for community engagement, signalling an inclusive atmosphere that values all contributions.

Adding a README file alongside the repository license, contribution guidelines, and code of conduct helps define project expectations and makes contributions easier to manage.
