# 11. How to add images to your project?

Pictorial illustrations are essential elements of content creation; they greatly help and simplify the understanding of the text and also facilitate navigation in the content. In this chapter, we look at how to add images to your markdown files in your GitHub repository.

## 1. Commit the image directly to your GitHub repository

Use a local image that is committed to your GitHub repository. However, instead of placing images in the root of your project, it is much better if you create an ‘Images’ folder within your repository to organise your image files and project better. 

In the screenshot below, you can see a project in which a separate ‘img’ folder was created for the images, making the folder structure more transparent:

It is perhaps one of the simplest methods; however, it has a significant drawback: you have to store the images locally, and if you store many images, they can increase the size of your repository.

Besides that, you need to be aware of the syntax of adding an image in a markdown file, which is as follows:


  **![Alt text](/relative path of the image/img.jpg "Optional title")**

  **![Alt text] (/posts/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")**

The Alt text (alternative text) describes the appearance or function of an image on a page. The alt text is read aloud by screen readers used by visually impaired users. Then comes the relative path to the image. 

It is a good practice to plan what kind of folder structure you create on your computer so that you can manage the images more efficiently. This method is best used when we do not have many images.

## 2. Use a remote file

Another option is to use an external file storage service (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.). In this case, you can get the direct and full URL of the image and then use it directly in your markdown file. 

You may also use [**other sources and tools for free images**](https://buffer.com/library/free-images/#understand-these-terms-before-using-any-free-images), and you can use the availability of the image where the given image is stored at the given service provider. Such sources include **Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Canva, and Flickr**, for example.

The method is the same, but the link to the image points to the service provider’s page (where the image is stored). So instead of using this:

  **![Alt text](/relative path of the image/img.jpg "Optional title")**

In the markdown file, you may use something like the below:

  ![Alley, Street, Umbrellas image from Pixabay Image by Fabien - Pixabay Ambassador from Pixabay](/ https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2023/10/02/16/20/alley-8289479_1280.jpg “Street Umbrellas”)

So, if you use the above reference in your markdown file, the below image will show on the screen:

But do not only think of the well-known file storage providers mentioned above (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.). You can also use open-source markdown editors to store your files, such as HedgeDoc, where you upload the image and only use the link generated by the editor. 

The only important thing is that the link should point to a hosting provider that you can use in your markdown file. In the example below, I show the link to the above-mentioned markdown editor (HedgeDoc), which I am using in my markdown file (and it has the same syntax):

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_fc88d3389321bcc9421e1b2c4ca82b29.png)

The only weak point of this solution is that you have no control over how long that image will be stored in that location. That is if the path of the used image changes (because it was either deleted or saved elsewhere by the service provider), then the given image will not appear in the markdown file of your GitHub project.

Fortunately, there is nothing to be afraid of since these service providers are connected to millions of users and provide them with access to these images, so the service provider is not interested in the goal of frequently changing the access path of the images.

## 3. Upload an image file to GitHub

You may upload an image to GitHub and use it to host your image for you. It is more like a workaround since GitHub does not have a feature specially developed for uploading images. For that purpose, add your images to some comment (an issue, a pull request, etc.) and copy the URL generated by GitHub.

You can directly drag and drop your image from your computer to a comment field on GitHub. Once the file is uploaded, a URL is generated, which you can copy-paste into your markdown file.

So open your repository, click ‘Issues’ and create a new issue. 

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_3e11f9cb5516be45e43cb4355d250443.png)

Name your issue, call it ‘images’, ‘image library’ or something similar. Then, locate your file on your machine and drag and drop the file/files as a comment.

This way, you are uploading your image to GitHub, and at the same time, GitHub generates a link to your newly uploaded image, and you can use that link to refer to that image by pasting it into your markdown file.
