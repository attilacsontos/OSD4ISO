# 9. Using GitHub exclusively - Collaborator

Collaboration can be done solely on GitHub by using its web interface and built-in features. Here is how writers can collaborate on a joint project exclusively using GitHub:

## 1.	Creating the Repository:

One team member starts the process by creating a new repository on GitHub. They log in to their GitHub account, navigate to the repositories tab, and click on "New" to create a new repository. They fill in the necessary details such as repository name, and description, and choose whether it's public or private. 

They can also decide when creating the repository whether to add a README file (recommended), or a .gitignore file, and choose a license or not.

## 2.	Collaborator Invitation:

The repository owner can invite collaborators by navigating to the repository's settings and clicking on the ‘Add people’ button in the lower part of the main screen. 

## 3.	Branching, Writing, and Editing:
Collaborators can directly create new branches, and write, and edit documents within the GitHub interface. 
## 4.	Committing Changes:

After making changes, collaborators can commit the changes directly within GitHub. They scroll down to the bottom of the edit screen, provide a commit message describing their changes, and click on the "Commit changes" button.

## 5.	Creating Pull Requests:

Collaborators can propose their changes for review by creating pull requests directly on GitHub. They navigate to the repository, click on the "Pull requests" tab, and then click on the green "New pull request" button.

Here, they select the branches they want to compare (e.g., their feature branch against the main branch), provide a title and description for the pull request, and click on "Create pull request."

## 6.	Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests:

Other collaborators or the repository owner can review the pull request by checking the changes, leaving comments, and approving or requesting modifications.

Once approved, the pull request can be merged directly on GitHub by clicking the green "Merge pull request" button.

## 7.	Continuous Collaboration:

Collaboration continues iteratively with collaborators creating branches, making changes, creating pull requests, reviewing each other's work, and merging changes as necessary.
